# Worksheet: Long Addition with Decimals 1
28 long addition exercises. Sum two addends, each 1 to 6 digits long with decimal places. This module also includes a python program (long_addition_with_decimals_1.py) which demonstrates solving each problem using python. This not only demonstrates how to use a software programming language to do addition but checks the correctness of each of the answers given. Refer to the comment section of the python program for more information.
