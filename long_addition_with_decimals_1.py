Summations are found in python by using the addition operator (+), in which two addends on either side are summed.
Basic usage is as follows:
    print(5 + 3) 
    sum = addendA + addendB
    difference = positive + (-negative)

Decimal points are represented by floating point values in programming (IEEE Standard 754).
Calculating values by hand and using a calculator are essentially different operations that yield effectively similar results.
When calculating by hand, a definite answer is always provided because you are calculating using the defition of operations and values.
Since memory within a computer is finite, bitwise operations are used to perform math, and precision and magnitude are factors that must be considered.
Pretty much, you are only able to be accurate within a specified range of magnitude and degree of precision (in a direct trade off).

    https://floating-point-gui.de/formats/fp/
    https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html

The other operations used in this program are print(), and format().
print() is used to display the results of the operation to the console.
format() is makes it look nice.

To run the program: 
    1. Open a terminal on a computer with python 3 installed (works with v2 as well)
    2. Navigate to a directory containing this file (long_addition_with_decimals_1.py)
    3. Run the program with the following command: python3 long_addition_with_decimals_1.py
    4. A print out of the sums should appear after the cursor

If error:
    a. make sure python is installed (run: python3 --version)
    b. make sure you have the file installed and in the current directory
    c. if you are still having issues or see any general issues in the programming please report using the contact information at end of file.
